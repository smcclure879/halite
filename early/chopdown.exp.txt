playing fake games all the way down the tree to insure this actually can be done..
Assume we are already down as far as
NCT3894132fake/h.32498fakex1Q/EXC/bullet5/charXXX-YYY/isLeaf for each of the following bullets
(so we are already pretty far down in the parse tree including split to bullets and with retained context of EXCLUDE, which works like AND_NOT XXX  AND_NOT YYY)

Bullet 1. Contraindications to radiotherapy (including active inflammatory bowel disease or prior pelvic XRT)
a. isLeaf results in _Complex
b. Complex results in XXXX  _kingword(including) YYYY
  1) XXXX=Contraindications to radiotherapy
  2) YYYY=active inflammatory bowel disease or prior pelvic XRT
     i) _isLeaf results in _OR
     ii) _OR results in active inflammatory bowel disease

** this notation is now too cumbersome, here is new one... sequence is roughly (  game-->whatLearned   )
isLeaf('Contraind....XRT') --> complex
complex-->kingword('including' meaning 'OR')     *** is this step too hard???
[split is caused: 'contra...' OR 'active infl...or prior...']
isLeaf('contraindications to radiotherapy')--->  ???Is this "complex" or _____?
[terminal]
isLeaf('active...or prior...')-->complex
complex-->kingword('or')
[split ...]
isLeaf('active inflammatory bowel disease')-->condition
condition-->  ???
[terminal]
isLeaf('prior pelvic XRT')--> ???Is this "test" or "procedure"???
[terminal]
